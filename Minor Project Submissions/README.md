Findings:
the quantitative data are:
                       #1. numcol
                       #2. yieldpercol  
                       #3  totalprod    
                       #4  stocks      
                       #5  priceperlb   
                       #6  prodvalue     
                       #7  year     
the quantitative data is state
"number of colonies" is showing positive correlation with stocks, production value and total production,if number of colonies will increase they all will increase
total production is showing direct relation with stocks
price per lb is showing direct relation with year
overall there is declining production trend
# there are mixed trends of total production of honey over years
it decreased from 1998 to 1999 and then incresed
again decresed till 2002 ,then increased in 2003 and decresed in 2004 again incresed in 2005 and so on
year 2010 has maximum honey production and minimum was in 2002
# There is no BAR plot observed in between "totalprod" and "valueprod"
# there is scatter plot between them.
#there is a mixed trend between them
# yeild per colony was maximum in 2002 followed by 2005 and 2001
# yeild per colony was minimum in 2007 
#yeild per colony is increasing from year 2010 to 2012
the state with maximum total production is ND the state with minimum production is SC
there is incresing production value over years when total production is declining
