Model Scores:
{'Logistic Regression': 0.8809523809523809,
 'KNN classifier': 0.8027210884353742,
 'Support Vector Machine': 0.8299319727891157,
 'Random forest': 0.8605442176870748,
 'Decision tree': 0.7993197278911565,
 'Naive Bayes': 0.7278911564625851}
According to graph best model is Logistic Regression
WHY LOGISTIC REGRESSION ?
since we can see from the graph the F1 score for "yes" is 33% for random forest and 48% for logistic regression and Accuracy for random forest is 86.05% and for logistic regression is 88% but recall of both is 99% so best model is Logistic regression .
